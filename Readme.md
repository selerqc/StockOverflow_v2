Purpose and Scope
StockOverflow_v2 is a comprehensive inventory management system designed for multi-tenant operations with role-based access control. The system provides a React-based frontend application connected to a Node.js/Express backend API with MongoDB data persistence. This document provides a high-level introduction to the system architecture, core technologies, and organizational structure.

The system supports three distinct user roles (Admin, Business Owner, Employee) with differentiated access to inventory management, user administration, analytics, and order processing capabilities. For detailed information about the frontend application structure, see Frontend Application. For backend API documentation, see Backend API.

System Architecture
StockOverflow_v2 follows a modern three-tier architecture with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers. The system implements comprehensive authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to resources based on user roles.

Role-Based Access Control
The system implements a sophisticated permission-based access control system with three primary user roles. Each role has specific route access and functional capabilities defined in the roleBasedRoutes configuration:

Role	Dashboard	Key Permissions	Restricted Features
Admin	admin-dashboard	Full system access, user management, all analytics	None - complete access
Business Owner	businessowner-dashboard	Employee management, business analytics, inventory control	User administration limited to employees
Employee	employee-dashboard	Limited inventory access, order processing, basic alerts	No user management, limited analytics
Permission System Structure
The application uses a granular permission system defined in the PERMISSIONS constants, which are enforced through the PermissionRoute component. Key permissions include:

VIEW_ANALYTICS - Access to dashboard analytics and reporting
VIEW_PRODUCTS - Product inventory viewing and management
VIEW_CATEGORIES - Category organization and management
VIEW_ORDERS - Order processing and tracking
VIEW_USERS - User administration (Admin only)
VIEW_EMPLOYEES - Employee management (Business Owner)
VIEW_ALERTS - System notifications and alerts
MANAGE_SETTINGS - User profile and system settings
